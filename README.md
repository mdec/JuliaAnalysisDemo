JuliaAnalysisDemo
=================

Demonstration of data analysis with Julia - this is a start-to-finish example of getting data, exploring it, and conducting analysis. It uses kidney cancer rate data available at http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/data/cancer/, which is used as an example in Andrew Gelman's book Bayesian Data Analysis.

This set of scripts and output will eventually be presented to the Research Triangle Analysts meetup group.
